Strangers in the night , exchanging glances
Wondering in the night ; what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night , two lonely people
We were strangers in the night.
